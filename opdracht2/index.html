            <h2 class="animatie-links">Hi, my name is Chevelly Hiralall</h2>
            <p class="animatie-links">...and I study the course Communication &#38; Multimedia Design. At CMD you learn to research, to invent and to create meaningful interactive, digital products and services such as websites, apps and interactive installations by involving the wishes, needs and characteristics of users in the design process. During my course at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam I did a lot of individual and team projects that helped me to reflect on my own strengths and weaknesses. My ambition is to become part of a creative team that believes in the power of ideas. My aim is to bring these ideas to life through the process of Creative Production. I believe that great ideas come from different minds and I like to work in a team, where everyone puts their own creativity in. Inspired by arts, culture, science and technology, I seek to create new ways of interaction.</p>

            <h2 class="animatie-links">PORTFOLIO</h2>
            <p class="animatie-top">In my foundation year I gained basic knowledge and skills that help me develop into a designer of interactive digital products. I learned to work with all kinds of techniques and programs that are important within the field. </p>

            <p class="animatie-top">The one where my qualities and affinity lie the most is with both Visual Communication and Interaction / UX Design. In other words, I like to be involved in design in the field of printing and digital expressions. And in addition, I also enjoy working on creating user-friendly applications that have an optimal user experience. I also have knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>

            <p class="animatie-top">Furthermore, I have an accurate multidisciplinary and structured way of working and I am always committed to the full 100% to deliver the best possible product that perfectly matches both the user and the preconditions of the assignment.</p>

            <h2 class="animatie-top">UX DESIGN</h2>
            <p class="animatie-top">Every international student who comes to study in Amsterdam receives the ISGA. The students will find practical information and great tips in the guide. The purpose of the guide is that the students quickly find their way in Amsterdam and surroundings and have a useful and pleasant time in the Netherlands. The guide is a physical booklet. I was asked to design a digital partner for the ISGA.
